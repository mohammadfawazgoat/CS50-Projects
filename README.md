# CS50 Projects

This repository contains my solutions to Harvard's **CS50** problem sets.  
CS50 is an introduction to computer science, covering fundamental concepts such as:

- Loops, conditions, and functions  
- Arrays and pointers  
- Cryptography (Caesar and VigenÃ¨re ciphers)  
- Algorithms (sorting and searching)  


More to come as I continue my journey! ðŸš€
