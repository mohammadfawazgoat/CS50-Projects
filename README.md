# CS50 Projects

This repository contains my solutions to Harvard's **CS50** problem sets.  
CS50 is an introduction to computer science, covering fundamental concepts such as:

- Loops, conditions, and functions  
- Arrays and pointers  
- Cryptography (Caesar and VigenÃ¨re ciphers)  
- Algorithms (sorting and searching)  

### Problem Sets Completed:
âœ… PSet 1: Mario & Credit  
âœ… PSet 2: Caesar Cipher  

More to come as I continue my journey! ðŸš€
